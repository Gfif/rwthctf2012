Rubik's cube ctf service in Haskell.

The Rubik's cube, which can be seen as a subgroup of the group
of permutations on 48 elements (= stickers), can be used as a
cayley hash function by mapping inputs to cube states ("scrambles").

This hash function is used for a Lamport one-time authentication
signature scheme.

Finding pre-images is equivalent to solving a Rubik's cube.
